## HOW TO SET UP WORKING WITH THIS REPOSITORY
- [Follow this youtube video] (https://youtube.com/watch?v=VGlD8uJGJl8&si=LyCSpI3dAnB7cuiQ) but use the following SDKs:
  - Download the JavaFX Library first using this link [JavaFX Gluon Version 23.0.1] (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
  - Then, use these libraries to bind with your project's Properties and Netbean's Java Platforms [AZUL JavaFX 24.30.01 JDK FX] (https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-24&os=windows&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk-fx#zulu)
- For Github in Netbeans, follow this guide: [youtube guide] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOIPS-ewFHg] and [basics of github] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ)
  - Note: DO NOT PUSH YOUR CODE DIRECTLY TO MAIN! Always create a branch first so that any errors can easily be reverted if it doesn't work out!
